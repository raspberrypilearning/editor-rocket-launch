<h2 class="c-project-heading--task">Blast off!</h2>

--- task ---
Each time a new frame is drawn, the rocket needs to move up the screen to create an animation effect.


![A rocket flying at a steady speed from the bottom to the top of the screen.](images/fly.gif){:width="300px"}

The `rocket_position` of the rocket will start at 400 (the screen height) and then decrease by 1 each time a new frame is drawn.

**Test:** Run your code to check that the rocket blasts off from the bottom of the screen.
