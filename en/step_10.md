<h2 class="c-project-heading--task">Remove the outline</h2>

--- task ---

➡️ Remove the outline of the circles to make them look more realistic.

--- /task ---

The outline around the circles is called the **stroke**. Add some code to turn it off. 

--- code ---
---
language: python
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 13
line_highlights: 14
---

    fill(200, 200, 200, 100) 
    no_stroke()
    

--- /code ---


**Test:** Run your program and you should see the same exhaust trail but without the outlines.
